Description of feature
We implement the feature that recommed the movies corresponding with seasons and genres. 
And we recommend the movies with top 10 ranking movies and randomly recommend movie.

Change: we change the implementation algorithm for seasoning recommendation feature
- Originally, we were going to recommend movies for each season by dividing the seasons 
 based on the time people reviewed them. However, we realized that it was impossible to 
 divide the seasons based on the time reviewd because there was a lack of data on the Internet 
 including review time, and when we checked the time they reviewed from the MovieLens' data, the
 time they reviewed for same movie appeared differently. Therefore, since movies are usually 
 released during the season when they are expected to be successful, we decided to recommend 
 movies for each season by dividing the seasons based on the release time of the movie.
